# Banking-Dataset_Marketing-Targets_Dataspaces-Exam
In this work the Bank Marketing Dataset was analyzed, which can be downloaded free of charge from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [HERE](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)

The dataset collects information from customers of a Portuguese bank between May 2008 and  November 2010 during a marketing campaign conducted by the bank, carried out by telephone on its customers. The bank has proposed to its customers a subscription for a term deposit.

The goal of the study was to provide an accurate classifier that would allow the bank to contact those customers most likely to subscribe.

The work was conducted with Python 3.8 with the help of the following libraries:
- Pandas and Numpy for data structures.
- Imblearn for rebalancing algorithm.
- Sklearn for classification algorithms.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for the realization of the graphs.
